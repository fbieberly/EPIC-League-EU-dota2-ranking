# EPIC League EU/CIS dota2 ranking

I was interested in knowing what the Glicko-2 ranking of the 10 teams competing in the EPIC League tournament during the round-robin group stage. On [liquipedia] the teams are sorted by simple win/loss record.  

[Glicko-2] is the ranking system used for many competitive sports/games--chess, go, Overwatch, etc.

# Comments

All teams started with the same ranking (1500) at the start of the competition.  
I don't really know much about Glicko-2 so, I could be handling the best-of-three series wrong.  
At the end of the group stage, it'll be interesting if any of the bottom two teams (that get kicked out) are ranked in the top 8 by the Glicko-2 algorithm. On day 8, the 9th place team is only 1 point behind the 8th place team.
